# Disaster Resource Management 
After a natural calamity, like floods or earthquakes, an efficient and dynamic allocation of resources is required for the people that are affected by the disaster. The first line of help during such events are the NGOs. 
## Abstract
We propose to create a solution which will help the NGOs and the government organizations:
1. Get an estimate of the number of people stranded/affected by the disaster in a particular region
2. Provide the organizations an estimate of the resources required in that region using prefed data in the database as well as getting realtime needs of the people using a mobile app
3. Provide a platform for the organizations where they can communicate with other NGO's and the people so that there is an efficient and dynamic allocation of resources and no affected region gets left out.

## Proposal 

### Mobile App
The mobile app will function for the people on the ground level who are working in the local area. They can post updates for the area and tell others how many people are there in a particular area, be it a household or a district. A map selector will be implemented so the organizations can see where the people exactly are. 
<br />The app will show how much quantity of a particular resource is required at a particular place. If an organization is already providing a resource to a place, others will be prompted to assist people in other regions so that no place is left out

## Future Propositions
Click for help: An open for all realtime system where anyone can ask questions they need answers to and post images (of injuries, etc) where only qualified people can answer
